# LTC4162

The LTC4162 is an advanced monolithic synchronous
step-down switching battery charger and PowerPathâ„¢
manager that seamlessly manages power distribution
between input sources such as wall adapters, backplanes,
solar panels, etc., and a rechargeable Lithium-Ion/Polymer
battery.
A high resolution measurement system provides exten-
sive telemetry information for circuit voltages, currents,
battery resistance and temperature which can all be read
back over the I2C port. The I2C port can also be used to
configure many charging parameters including charging
voltages and currents, termination algorithms and numer-
ous system status alerts.

To retrieve the data, call `OBC.EPS.get()`. All results can be retrieved from the variables `vbat`, `vin`, `vout`, `ibat`, `iin`, `die_temp`, and `temperature`.

**Simple example:**

```c
OBC.EPS.get();
Serial.print("Vbat = ");
Serial.println(OBC.EPS.vbat);
```
